    <h1>Bicol Express</h1>
        <img src="https://www.createwithnestle.ph/sites/default/files/srh_recipes/20aa4eaebfd862d05c43a2848e9a349a.png" alt="Bicol Express">
        <p>The mild sweetness of coconut milk brings a sense of delight to the sharp notes of chili pepper and bagoong in the classic Bicol Express recipe. This contrast has long created a spell-binding richness in taste for the dish. And this has helped make it arguably one of the most popular Filipino dishes.
            And righteously so, as it has all of the well-meaning components of classic savory Philippine cuisine. Not only does it contain a generous amount of meat in some succulent, juicy pork belly, but it is also enriched by a local favorite to season and bring some unique flavor to the dishâ€“ shrimp paste or bagoong.
            Bicol Express, in all of its well-balanced spice and sweetness, also makes for an irresistible cold day meal. With a creamy, delicious stew containing ginger, and a generous amount of essential seasonings in salt and pepper, the flavors come together for the most comforting spoonful of meat and soup.
